## About

Test your responsive website from the WordPress admin bar. This plugin uses the excellent [Viewport Resizer bookmarklet](http://lab.maltewassermann.com/viewport-resizer/) to add a responsive button to the WordPress admin bar. Once pressed you can easily test your site in a range of common viewport sizes (e.g. iPhone, Tablet and Desktop).

The plugin is handy for testing during development and also for writers and editors to preview their content on different devices.
